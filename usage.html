<h2 id="startingtheapplication">Starting the Application</h2>

<p>We hope that you have successfully installed the application as outlined
<a href="./install.html">here</a>. If you have installed it from CPAN, you need to start
the application like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ financeta
</code></pre>

<p>If you have installed the software from Github, you are running it in developer
mode and you should be running it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -Mblib ./bin/financeta
</code></pre>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="./install.html">install</a> page for more details on
installing the application from Github and CPAN.</p>

<p>On Linux and other Unix variants, you need X-server running to view the GUI. On
Mac OS X, if you have installed Gnuplot, you will already have X-server
installed and the application should automatically start it up.</p>

<h2 id="selectingasecurity">Selecting a Security</h2>

<p>When we refer to the word <em>security</em>, we mean a company stock. However, as time
progresses and if data is freely available, we will be adding options and
futures to the mix as well. Hence <em>security</em> is a term that groups all of these
under one.</p>

<p>Using the menu option <em>'Security'</em> followed by <em>'New'</em> as shown in the image below,
start the <em>'Security Wizard'</em> dialog. Enter a <span
style="color:red;"><strong>valid</strong></span> stock symbol such as <em>'MSFT'</em> in
the <em>'Enter Security Symbol'</em> text box, select the start and end dates for which
you want data for (by default this is set to one year back from today) and hit
the <em>'OK'</em> button.</p>

<p>You will see a new tab opens with the name of the symbol you entered, which is
<em>'MSFT'</em> in this case and all the stock data listed in tabular form. You will
also see a plot drawn in Gnuplot in a separate window and started up as shown.</p>

<p>The steps are outlined as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select <em>'New'</em> from the <em>'Security'</em> menu option
<img src="./images/security_new.png" alt="Select New from the 'Security' menu option" title="Select 'New' from the 'Security' menu option" id="selectnewfromthesecuritymenuoption" /></li>
<li>Enter a <span style="color:red;"><strong>valid</strong></span> stock symbol and date range in the <em>'Security Wizard'</em> such as <em>'MSFT'</em>
<img src="./images/security_wizard.png" alt="Select a Stock Symbol in the Security Wizard" title="Enter a valid stock symbol in the 'Security Wizard'" id="selectastocksymbolinthesecuritywizard" /></li>
<li>View the retrieved data in a tab titled <em>'MSFT'</em> or the symbol you have
chosen
<img src="./images/security_data.png" alt="View the data retrieved in a tab" title="View the data retrieved in a tab for that symbol" id="viewthedataretrievedinatab" /></li>
<li>View the open-high-low-close (OHLC) bar plot in Gnuplot that has been started
by <em>App::financeta</em>
<img src="./images/security_plot_ohlc.png" alt="OHLC Gnuplot for data" title="View the OHLC default plot in the adjacent Gnuplot window" id="ohlcgnuplotfordata" /></li>
