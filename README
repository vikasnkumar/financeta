DEPENDENCIES FOR DEVELOPERS

    Linux

      For Linux, such as Debian/Ubuntu based systems like Debian Bullseye
      or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, you want the following packages installed:

          libheif-dev libwebp-dev libxpm-dev libgtk-3-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev gnuplot

      Then you build Prima, PDL, PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot,
      PDL::Graphics::Simple, Mo, IO::All.

    Windows

      For Windows you need Strawberry Perl installed and install Prima,
      PDL, PDL::Graphics::Prima, PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot,
      PDL::Graphics::Simple.

      You will want to install Gnuplot 5.2.8 from their website. The
      version that is 5.4 and above is not supported at the moment due to
      issues with IPC.

    Mac OSX

      It is quite a lot of work to get this working on Mac OSX. We have
      tested it on Monterey. You will need HomeBrew from <https://brew.sh>
      setup and install the following packages: gnuplot, xorg-server,
      cmake, openssl, perl, xinit, fribidi, pkg-config, xquartz,
      dk/libthai/libthai, libheif, gtk+3.

      It may or may not work here.
