NAME
    PDL::Finance::TA

SYNOPSIS
    PDL::Finance::TA is a perl module allowing the user to perform technical
    analysis on financial data stored as PDLs. It is the basis of the
    graphics application App::financeta which can be used by users to do
    financial stocks research with Technical Analysis.

VERSION
    0.04

METHODS
    new Creates a new instance of `PDL::Finance::TA'. Takes in various
        properties that the user might want to override. Check the
        PROPERTIES section to view the different properties.

    run This function starts the graphical user interface (GUI) and uses
        POE::Loop::Prima and Prima to do all its work. This is our current
        choice of the GUI framework but it need not be in the future.

PROPERTIES
    debug
        Turn on debug printing of comments on the terminal. Set it to 1 to
        enable and 0 or undef to disable.

    timezone
        Default is set to *America/New_York*.

    brand
        Default is set to PDL::Finance::TA. Changing this will change the
        application name. Useful if the user wants to embed
        `PDL::Finance::TA' in another application.

    icon
        Picks up the file in `PDL/Finance/TA/images/icon.gif' as the
        application icon but can be given as a `Prima::Icon' object as well.

    tmpdir
        The default on Windows is `$ENV{TMP}' or `$ENV{TEMP}' and on Unix
        based systems is `$ENV{TMPDIR}' if it is set or `/tmp' if none are
        set. The CSV files that are downloaded and temporary data is stored
        here.
