NAME
    PDL::Finance::TA

SYNOPSIS
    PDL::Finance::TA is a perl module allowing the user to perform technical
    analysis on financial data stored as PDLs.

VERSION
    0.01

METHODS
    movavg $p, $N
        The `movavg()' function takes two arguments, a pdl object and the
        number of elements over which to calculate the simple moving
        average. It can be invoked in two ways:

            use PDL;
            use PDL::Finance::TA 'movavg';
            my $ma_13 = $p->movavg(13); # the 13-day moving average
            my $ma_21 = movavg($p, 21); # the 21-day moving average

        For a nice example on how to use moving averages and plot them see
        *examples/movavg.pl*.

    expmovavg $p, $N, $alpha
        The `expmovavg()' function takes three arguments, a pdl object, the
        number of elements over which to calculate the exponential moving
        avergage and the exponent to use to calculate the moving average. If
        the number of elements is 0 or `undef' then all the elements are
        used to calculate the value. If the exponent argument is `undef',
        the value of (2 / (N + 1)) is assumed.

        For a nice example on how to use and compare exponential moving
        average to the simple moving average look at
        *examples/expmovavg.pl*.
