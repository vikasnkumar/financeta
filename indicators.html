<h1 id="indicators">Indicators</h1>

<p><em>App::financeta</em> supports a variety of indicators, about 132 of them. Here we
try to explain each one of them and for those that have better references
elsewhere we link to detailed explanations to those sites. We felt that there
was no reason to copy some other site&#8217;s text when we could just link to their
efforts.</p>

<p>Each indicator&#8217;s parameters are listed if necessary and explanations are given
as required for understanding how to use the indicator.</p>

<h2 id="overlapstudies">Overlap Studies</h2>

<p>These group of <u>trend following</u> indicators work with the Close price of the security being used
as the input. They overlap the actual security price chart and hence the name.</p>

<h3 id="movingaveragema">Moving Average (MA)</h3>

<p>Moving average is the easiest and simplest smoothing indicator used by technical
analysts and algorithmic traders. Fundamentally, they are implemented as running
an averaging formula over a rolling window of prices.</p>

<p>Analysts use a combination of various moving average lines to create simple
trading rules for securities. The moving average along with a few other
indicators can be applied to any kind of security such as stocks, futures or
options to smooth the volatility over fixed periods and get an idea of how to
see trends in a price.</p>

<p>For more details refer the resources at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average">Wikipedia</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.metastock.com/Customer/Resources/TAAZ/Default.aspx?p=74">Metastock</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are many popular methods of calculating the moving average which are
explained in the following sections.</p>

<p>This indicator is actually a collective indicator in the sense that selecting
this indicator allows the user to choose which type of moving average they would
like to pick. The indicator takes two parameters: the period window which is a
valid integer between 2 and 100,000 and the type of moving average. Each of
these types of moving averages are explained below.</p>

<h4 id="simplemovingaveragesma">Simple Moving Average (SMA)</h4>

<p>The simple moving average uses the simplest averaging formula over the period
window of prices. It simply adds all the prices in the period window divided by
the value of the period window.</p>

<p>There is only one parameter for this indicator: the period window which is a
valid integer between 2 and 100,000.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="exponentialmovingaverageema">Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</h4>

<p>The exponential moving average is one of the most useful moving average
indicators being used today. It has a faster reaction time compared to the
SMA. The ratio or &alpha; is automatically calculated based on the period
window.</p>

<p>There is only one parameter for this indicator: the period window which is a
valid integer between 2 and 100,000.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="tripleexponentialmovingaveraget3">Triple Exponential Moving Average (T3)</h4>

<p>The T3 is similar to the DEMA but adds a volume factor (<code>vfactor</code>) based
scaling to the DEMA calculation. The <code>vfactor</code> is a real number between 0.0 and
1.0. A typical value for <code>vfactor</code> is 0.7. If the <code>vfactor</code> is 0.0 then T3 is
the same as EMA and if it is 1.0 then T3 is the same as DEMA.</p>

<p>There are two parameters for this indicator: the volume factor which is a real number
between 0.0 and 1.0, and the period window which is a valid integer between 2 and 100,000.</p>

<h4 id="movingaveragewithvariableperiodmavp">Moving Average with Variable Period (MAVP)</h4>

<p>This is a type of <em>Adaptive</em> moving average where the user provides a list of
periods to use to calculate the moving average of the series. In other words,
the period window cycles through the list and all the different moving average
series are merged into one.</p>

<p>This indicator takes four arguments: a list of integers (comma-separated)
denoting the different periods to use, a minimum period value, a maximum period
value and the type of moving average to use.</p>

<p>For example, the list of integers for the variable periods can be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci#Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci
sequence</a> of numbers
such as <code>2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34</code> and so on.</p>

<h4 id="kaufmanadaptivemovingaveragekama">Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA)</h4>

<h3 id="bollingerbandsbbands">Bollinger Bands (BBANDS)</h3>

<p>Bollinger Bands is a popular volatility indicator used to indicate the rise and fall of
a price relative to previous trade prices. It consists of a type of periodic
moving average, an upper band a few standard deviations above the moving average
and a lower band a few standard deviations below the moving average.</p>

<p>There are four parameters for this indicator: the period window, the number of
standard deviations for the upper band, the number of standard deviations for
the lower band, and the type of moving average to use.</p>

<h3 id="parabolicstopandreversesar">Parabolic Stop And Reverse (SAR)</h3>

<p>This is a popular indicator designed to find potential reversals in the market
price direction. This is a lagging indicator and may be used as a stop-loss
trigger. A parabola below the price is considered <em>bearish</em> and above the price
is considered <em>bullish</em>. This indicator works on the high and low prices of the
security rather than the close price like the moving average indicators.</p>

<p>There are two parameters for this indicator: an acceleration factor which is a
positive real number and the maximum acceleration factor to use. The default
value of acceleration factor is 0.02 and the maximum acceleration factor is 0.2.</p>

<p>For more details refer the resources at:</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="parabolicstopandreverse-extendedsarext">Parabolic Stop And Reverse - Extended (SAREXT)</h3>

<p>This is an extension to the above SAR indicator which gives the user the freedom
to use different acceleration factors for the long and short side trades.</p>

<p>There are many parameters that are configurable here:</p>

<ul>
<li>the start value which is a real number that denotes the start value and the
 sign of the number decides whether it is the long direction if positive, or the short
direction if negative, or auto-detect if 0. The default is 0.</li>
<li>the percentage offset added or removed to the initial stop on the short or
 long reversal. The default is 0.</li>
<li>the initial acceleration factor for the long direction. The default value is
 0.02.</li>
<li>the acceleration factor for the long direction, with a default value of 0.02.</li>
<li>the maximum acceleration factor for the long direction, with a default value
 of 0.2.</li>
<li>the initial acceleration factor for the short direction. The default value is
 0.02.</li>
<li>the acceleration factor for the short direction, with a default value of 0.02.</li>
<li>the maximum acceleration factor for the short direction, with a default value
 of 0.02.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all the default values are used, SAREXT is the same as SAR.</p>

<p>The momentum indicator measures the acceleration or deceleration of prices over
a rolling period window. The indicator is applied to the close price, although
it can be applied to any data series.</p>

<p>There is only one parameter for this indicator: the period window which is a
valid integer between 1 and 100,000.</p>

<p>The plot of this indicator shows up as a sub-plot on the regular plot window.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="movingaverageconvergence-divergencemacd">Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)</h3>

<p>MACD is a very popular indicator that reveals changes in strength, direction,
momentum and duration of a trend in a security&#8217;s price. It generates three outputs:
the MACD output, the MACD signal and the MACD histogram (or the divergence
series) which is the difference between the MACD output and the MACD signal.</p>

<p>The plot of this indicator shows up as a sub-plot on the regular plot window.
The histogram shows up as a bar chart and the MACD output and signal are
overlaid on the histogram.</p>

<p>A combination of the crossing over of the MACD output and the signal over the
zero-line can be used to create buy/sell signals for trading.</p>

<p>The calculation for the MACD is the difference of two moving average series created
using two different period windows - fast and slow - where the fast period
window is shorter than the slow period window. The MACD signal is the moving
average of the MACD output itself over a period window generally referred to as
the smoothing period window.</p>

<p>There are three parameters for this indicator:</p>

<ul>
<li>fast period window which is a valid integer from 2 to 100,000</li>
<li>slow period window which is a valid integer from 2 to 100,000</li>
<li>signal smoothing period window which is a valid integer from 1 to 100,000</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common values of the period windows are 12 (fast), 26 (slow) and 9
(signal).</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="macd-withema">MACD - with EMA</h4>

<p>This is the default MACD indicator which uses the
<a href="#exponentialmovingaverageema">EMA</a> to do the moving average.</p>

<h4 id="macd-extended">MACD - Extended</h4>

<p>This is the extended MACD indicator which allows the user to select a different
moving average type for each of the fast, slow and signal smoothing period
windows. If the user selects <a href="#exponentialmovingaverageema">EMA</a> for all, then this is the same as the default
MACD. The default moving average types are set to
<a href="#simplemovingaveragesma">SMA</a>.</p>

<h4 id="macdfixed1226withema">MACD Fixed 12/26 with EMA</h4>

<p>This is a quicker implementation of the indicator where the user only selects
the signal smoothing period window. The slow and fast period windows are fixed
to 26 and 12, respectively. The moving average type is fixed to
<a href="#exponentialmovingaverageema">EMA</a>.</p>

<h3 id="moneyflowindexmfi">Money Flow Index (MFI)</h3>

<p>MFI is an index with values between 0 and 100 used to show the value of a day&#8217;s
trading over a rolling period window. It calculates a positive and negative
money flow based on the <a href="#typicalpriceakapivotpoint">typical price</a> and volume
directions and gives a scaled ratio between 0 to 100.</p>

<p>It is used to determine the <em>enthusiasm</em> of the market based on how much a
security has been traded.</p>

<p>This indicator has one parameter: the period window which is an integer between
2 and 100,000.</p>

<p>The plot of this indicator shows up as a sub-plot on the regular plot window.</p>

<h3 id="relativestrengthindexrsi">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h3>

<p>The RSI is a popular momentum indicator measuring the velocity and magnitude of
directional price movements over a rolling period window. It is generally used
in tandem with <a href="#movingaverageconvergence-divergencemacd">MACD</a> and
<a href="#stochastic">Stochastic</a> to create buy and sell signals.</p>

<h3 id="rateofchangeroc">Rate of Change (ROC)</h3>

<p>The ROC is the ratio of the change in the close price today with respect to the
close price a fixed number of days ago. This indicator is generally a fraction
depicting the trend in the prices over time. It is used in tandem with the
<a href="#momentum">Momentum</a> indicator.</p>

<p>This indicator takes one parameter: a period window which is an integer value
between 1 and 100,000. The default period window is 10.</p>

<h3 id="stochastic">Stochastic</h3>

<p>The stochastic indicator refers to the point of a current price in relation to
the price range over time. The method tries to predict the turn in price change
by comparing the closing price to the price range.</p>

<p>There are two signals named <code>K</code> and <code>D</code> created by using the high, low and
close prices over a fast and slow period window for the <code>K</code> and the <code>D</code> signals.</p>

<p>Typical fast and slow period windows for <code>K</code> and <code>D</code> are 5 and 3, respectively.</p>

<p>The plot of this indicator shows up as a sub-plot on the regular plot window.</p>

<h3 id="beta">Beta</h3>

<p>The Beta indicator compares one security with another to give the user an
indication on how these securities move with respect to each other in the
market. The other security could be an index like Dow Jones Industrial Average
or S&amp;P 500 or could be another security itself.</p>

<p>The most common usage of Beta is to understand the volatility of a security with
respect to a market index. A value less than 1 implies the security varies less
than the market and a value greater than 1 implies the security varies more than
the market and if the value is 1 the security follows the market.</p>

<p>Beta is calculated using a rolling period window which is an integer between 1
and 100,000 with a default value of 5.</p>

<p>The plot of this indicator has the second security overlaid on the first
security and a sub-plot showing the Beta line.</p>

of the securities moves in an opposite direction to the other and a positive
value implies they move in sync. The closer these values are to the 1.0 line,
the more correlated these securities are to one another.</p>

<p>The correlation coefficient is calculated using a rolling period window which is an integer
between 1 and 100,000 with a default value of 5.</p>
