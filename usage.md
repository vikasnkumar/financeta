# Using _App::financeta_

## Starting the Application

We hope that you have successfully installed the application as outlined
[here](./install.html). If you have installed it from CPAN, you need to start
the application like this:

    $ financeta

If you have installed the software from Github, you are running it in developer
mode and you should be running it like this:

    $ perl -Mblib ./bin/financeta

Please refer to the [install](./install.html) page for more details on
installing the application from Github and CPAN.

On Linux and other Unix variants, you need X-server running to view the GUI. On
Mac OS X, if you have installed Gnuplot, you will already have X-server
installed and the application should automatically start it up.

## Selecting a Security

When we refer to the word _security_, we mean a company stock. However, as time
progresses and if data is freely available, we will be adding options and
futures to the mix as well. Hence _security_ is a term that groups all of these
under one.
