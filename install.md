#Installing _App::financeta_

## Hardware Requirements

The software will perform well and fast if you're using an Intel or AMD
multi-core CPU made by them after 2007. You will benefit if you have more than
2GB RAM although the application should run within 300MB, but that depends on
how much data you're analyzing. PDL does a lot of parallel computations which
benefit with a multi-core and/or a multi-cpu system.

The software has not been tested on ARM CPU based systems, and if there are any success
reports, please let the authors know and we shall include them here.

If you want us to support a different CPU type, please contact the authors.
