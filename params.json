{"name":"PDL-Finance-TA","tagline":"PDL::Finance::TA is a Technical Analysis library wrapper around ta-lib for the Perl Data Language (PDL)","body":"### PDL::Finance::TA\r\n\r\n[`PDL`](http://pdl.perl.org/) or the Perl Data Language is a language extension of Perl that enables Perl programmers and users to perform various mathematical and statistical analysis on large data sets really fast. Most of it has been implemented in C and it allows users to use the magic of Perl along with `PDL` to build modelling and data analysis software. One can use `PDL` instead of R, Python (`NumPy`) or MATLAB to do their work in Perl completely without having to learn other languages while still maintaining the ease of use of Perl.\r\n\r\nWith the intentions of using `PDL` in financial research, I decided to bring [`PDL::Finance::TA`](https://github.com/vikasnkumar/PDL-Finance-TA/tree/master) to the masses. `TA` in the name stands for [Technical Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis) which is used by various researchers and traders alike to perform analyses and write trading strategies. The hope is that Perl users and non-users discover that `PDL` is a very capable tool with various connected graphics libraries that can be better and faster than standard methods of using languages like R, Python (`NumPy`) or MATLAB.\r\n\r\nPlease read the following in order of occurrence to learn about `PDL::Finance::TA`:\r\n\r\n1.
